# Draw-A-Person-Test
 Draw-a-Person (DAP) test is a human figure drawing test which is meant to be administered for children. It is a projective test, which allows the examinee to respond to questions through drawings. The test aims to assess different psychological aspects, including the personality, family background, intelligence, physical and emotional abuse, depression, etc, scoring the drawing for presence and quality of figure features, comparing the score to the examinee’s typical rate of acquisition of figure features. 
 
 DAP test was evolved from 1948 authored by Karen Machover. According to Bond, Southers, and Sproul (2015), it was supposedly to supplement the Stanford Binet intelligence test, with an option of a non-verbal test. However, it was discovered later on that the details in the test were more useful, giving birth to the first assessment tool by Florence Goodenough, which was the Draw-a-Man test. 
 
 The DAP test mobile application that the researchers developed is specifically targeted for children aged 5 below, wherein they are asked to draw a human figure. The system will then, go through the scoring checklist for Goodenough’s test from the University of Washington and assess the drawing made by the examinee. The DAP test system will determine the mental age equivalents of the scores from the examinees. Measuring an individual’s mental attainment based on age, aids in the calculation of IQ (Intelligence Quotient) to help determine if the child could potentially have intellectual disabilities or to measure the child’s intellectual potential. 
 
 The researchers used the ShortStraw, a corner detection algorithm to utilize the examinee’s stroke’s curvature in drawing to split drawn strokes into primitive building blocks such as lines or arcs. These strokes are then to be recognized into a set of building block shapes or forms.<br>
